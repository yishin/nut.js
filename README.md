but additionally gives you the possibility to navigate the screen based on image matching.

} = require("@nut-tree/plugin-ocr");

configure({ languageModelType: LanguageModelType.BEST });

useConsoleLogger({ logLevel: ConsoleLogLevel.DEBUG });

screen.config.autoHighlight = true;
screen.config.ocrConfidence = 0.8;

function activeWindowRegion() {
  return getActiveWindow().then((activeWindow) => activeWindow.region);
}

(async () => {
  await preloadLanguages([Language.English], [LanguageModelType.BEST]);
  await sleep(5000);
  const result = await screen.find(singleWord("@nut-tree/nut-js"));
  await mouse.move(straightTo(centerOf(result)));
  await mouse.click(Button.LEFT);
  await screen.waitFor(singleWord("Native"), 15000, 1000, {
    providerData: { partialMatch: true },
  });
  const content = await screen.read({ searchRegion: activeWindowRegion() });
  console.log(content);
})();
```

# Installation

## Prerequisites

This section lists runtime requirements for `nut.js` on the respective target platform.

#### Windows

In case you're running Windows 10 N and want to use [ImageFinder plugins](https://nutjs.dev/plugins/imagefinder), please make sure to have the [Media Feature Pack](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/media-feature-pack-for-windows-10-n-may-2020-ebbdf559-b84c-0fc2-bd51-e23c9f6a4439) installed.

#### macOS

On macOS, Xcode command line tools are required.
You can install them by running

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

**Permissions**:

nut.js requires the executing application, e.g. your terminal, to be given both `Accessibility` and `Screen Recording` permissions.

Starting with release `2.3.0`, nut.js will check for and request these permissions automatically:

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/nut-tree/nut.js/raw/develop/.gfx/permissions_popup.png" alt="Popup requesting screen recording permissions"/>
</p>

It will also give you a subtle hint in case permissions are lacking:

- Accessibility: `##### WARNING! The application running this script is not a trusted process! Please visit https://github.com/nut-tree/nut.js#macos #####`
- Screen Recording: `##### WARNING! The application running this script is not allowed to capture screen content! Please visit https://github.com/nut-tree/nut.js#macos #####`

**Attention**:

Prior to release `2.3.0` you'll have to grant these permissions manually.

`Settings -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy tab -> Accessibility -> Add...`

For example, if you want to execute your node script in e.g. `iTerm2`, you'd have to add `iTerm.app` to the list.
When running your script from a built-in terminal in e.g. `VSCode` or `IntelliJ`, you'd have to add the respective IDE.

</p>

#### Linux

Depending on your distribution, Linux setups may differ.

In general, `nut.js` requires

- libXtst

Installation on `*buntu` distributions:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libxtst-dev
```

Setups on other distributions might differ.

**Attention**:

At the moment nut.js only supports X11.

Wayland is **NOT** supported!

On e.g. Ubuntu you can switch to XWayland on your login screen as a workaround.

## Install `nut.js`

Running

```bash
npm i @nut-tree/nut-js
```

or

```bash
yarn add @nut-tree/nut-js
```

will install `nut.js` and its required dependencies.

### Snapshot releases

`nut.js` also provides snapshot releases which allows to test upcoming features.

Running

```bash
npm i @nut-tree/nut-js@next
```

or

```bash
yarn add @nut-tree/nut-js@next
```

will install the most recent development release of `nut.js`.

**Attention**: While snapshot releases are great to work with upcoming features before a new stable release, it is still a snapshot release.
Please bear in mind that things might change and / or break on snapshot releases, so it is not recommended using them in production.
